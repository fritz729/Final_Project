# Final_Project


## Overview

#### About the dataset
The topic our team chose deals with the salary ranges for various Data Scientist positions. We chose this topic because all 4 of our team members are either working in the data science field or potentially transfering to the field. Hopefully, this data analysis will help our team, and others, find answers that will determine the next steps they should take in their data science career. Over the next few weeks our team will be analyzing salaries and how salaries are impacted by a variety of skillsets, locations, degrees, and more. The original dataset being used in our project was collected by Glassdoor and plushed to Kaggle. In addition to our original dataset, we have added a dataset called "data science and STEM Salaries". 

#### Team Roles
- Square: Reid Vogel will be responsible for our teams repository.
- Triangle: Fritz is responsible for the machine learning model. 
- Circle: Megan Willard is responsible for creating and maintaining our teams databases. 
- X: Gabe Barletta is responsible for deciding which technologies to use for each step. 


#### Communication Protocols
Our team's main source of communication is through slack. We have scheduled zoom meetings every Tuesday and Thursday from 7pm to 9pm eastern. We schedule additional meetings through our slack group message.
